# battle

Tools for LNM battle engine: solving battles, generating logs, etc.

## Why Elixir?

This is the core of the battle mathematics solving. I want this
brick to be easy to read and reason about. Elixir is the dope.
It is fast enough, it is clean, and Erlang/Elixir standard
library is huge enough to avoid external dependencies and
noisy boilerplate.
